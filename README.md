# autoGrader
I am lazy; therefore, I spend hours coding a script so that I don't need to tally grades. 

# Instructions
## setup grading environment
## autograder.m
When grading, mark deductions starting on a new line with `%!`. End the line with a number in parentheses totalling the deduction. e.g.
`%! Error with disp() (-5)`
